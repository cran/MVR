o RELEASE 1.10.0
- Minor fixes in the documentation.
- The synthetic dataset is downsized to 200 variables (instead of 1000) with 40 of them (instead of 200) that are significantly different between the two sample groups.
- Major bug fix in the internal function MeanVarReg, which was not returning the correct cluster membership values. This was affecting especially the end-user function mvrt.test().
